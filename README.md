Hi! In order to learn more about Unit testing, I've finished the first part of the course Unit Testing in C# 2022 with Teddy Smith on YouTube. 

It's separated into two parts in order to maintain a certain order here haha.

In the first class, we learn everything about the testing idea, like the rules around it and how, where and when to use it. We were introduced to the Triple A rule, and it made the whole test concept flow. So, we build a simple function just to get used to the idea of testing without using any framework. 
In the second class, we were introduced to the framework XUnit and added the extension methods Fluent Assertions, which helped a lot to understand it better.
The third one was like a second part of the last one, so we continue to see XUnit and Fluent Assertions but with other types of data, like objects, IEnumerable and data.
For this part, the last class, the fourth one, was the one I was most interested in when introduced to FakeItEasy. I've never seen this framework, and it blew my mind! I've had contact with a production project with unit testing in my career, but it was without any mocking framework, so I used to create a whole mock object, and it was PAINFUL hahah! 

This course has 8 chapters, but in order to maintain order on the repository, I've decided to separate it into two parts, simply because in the fifth class we use a whole project to test, and I already have 3 here.

If you want to see the second part, here's the link of the <a href="https://github.com/JoanaDosSantos/UnitTestsCourse-WithTeddySmith-Part2">second part.

Thanks, Joana :D
